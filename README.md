# Machine Learning Model Comparison Project

## Overview

Developed a project to compare different machine learning algorithms for a classification problem. The approaches used in this project include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting. This project demonstrates skills in machine learning, model evaluation, and data analysis.

## Features

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - Implements the KNN algorithm to classify data points based on their nearest neighbors.
  
- **Naive Bayes**
  - Uses the Naive Bayes classifier for probabilistic classification.
  
- **Random Forest**
  - Applies the Random Forest algorithm to create an ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy.
  
- **Decision Tree**
  - Utilizes the Decision Tree algorithm to model decisions and their possible consequences.
  
- **Gradient Boosting**
  - Implements the Gradient Boosting algorithm to improve predictive accuracy through iterative refinement.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib
